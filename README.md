Since joining GitHub almost a decade ago, this profile has never seen much activity, until early 2023, when I finally decided to get serious about my programming wants and I attended a 7 month training/bootcamp for AI & Data Science. 

I learned how to be a Data Engineer and got familiar with its tools and skills of choice; Python, SQL, ETL, and much more.

You can find the collection of projects and use-cases I've made and worked on. Hopefully you like what you see!
